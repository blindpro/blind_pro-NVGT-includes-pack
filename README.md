# blind\_pro NVGT includes pack

Some includes that you can use in your NVGT projects.

You can find some documentation of the includes in the form of comments inside of the code.

Note that you may have to comment out the speak function in stuff.nvgt if you are using audioform or using the menu class. This is because those classes have speak functions with them, and it will cause a name conflict if you don't comment it out.
The unzip.bat in the lib folder is something you need to use the unzip file function in the stuff.nvgt file. The script runs the .bat file, and it will unzip the folder that is past to it.
You can find more documentation on the includes in the documentation folder.
